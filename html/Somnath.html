He married his 27 daughters to Chandra, the moon god. Chandra loved one of the sisters Rohini very much. So much that Chandra started ignoring his other wives and started spending all of his time with Rohini.Naturally, this angered his remaining 26 wives. They all went to their father Daksha and complained. Daksha then talked to Chandra and reminded him that he had 27 wives and he should take care of each one of them. Chandra agreed but later kept on spending all his time with Rohini only.This angered Daksha too. He cursed Chandra that his body would perish. This impacted everyone since Chandra was the only source of light in the night sky.Chandra and other gods went to Lord Brahma to get his help. Brahma asked Chandra to worship Lord Shiva and ask for his help.As instructed, Chandra made a Shivlinga and started worshipping Shiva. This pleased Shiva, who appeared before him and told him to ask for a boon. Chandra asked Shiva to undo the curse upon him.Shiva told him that the curse can not be undone, but he can minimize the effect. He blessed Chandra that once he perishes, he will again start regaining his body. Shiva also let Chandra live on his head so that no one else could harm him in his weaker state.Thus the moon waxes and wanes. Since then Shiva is also known as Chandrasekhar and Somnath (Som means moon or Chandra).Chandra made a temple where he worshipped Lord Shiva. The Shivlinga that he made transformed into a Jyotirlinga when Lord Shiva agreed to leave a part of himself there</p>
