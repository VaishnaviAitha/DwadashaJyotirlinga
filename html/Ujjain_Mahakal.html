One by one they were destroying the cities and villages.When they were coming towards Ujjain, the sages who lived in the nearby forests saw the army. They started praying to Lord Shiva to come and save the city. Even when the demon army was destroying the forest and everything in their path, the sages kept praying.Ultimately, Dushana and his army reached the sages and were about to kill them. Sages didn’t run away seeing the demons. They kept worshipping Lord Shiva. This pleased Lord Shiva and he appeared there himself.
            Lord Shiva was angry and his wrath was directed towards the demon army. A bloody battle took place where Lord Shiva killed Dushana and his entire army.A Jyotirlinga appeared in the place where Lord Shiva first appeared. His this fierce form is known as Mahakal since he came as Lord of Death. This is the reason why the idol in this temple is facing south, unlike all other temples. It is said that only in death one faces south. Lord Shiva is representing death itself and his idol is Dakshinmukhi or facing south.</p>
