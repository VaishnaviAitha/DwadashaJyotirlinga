            Once the mountain range, Vindhya worshipped Lord Shiva to get his blessings. He made a Shivlinga from mud and started his worship. He kept worshipping for a long time. When Lord Shiva appeared in front of Vindhya, he asked Vindhya to ask for any boon.Vindhya asked Lord Shiva to live on the mountain range. So, Lord Shiva created a Jyotirlinga where a part of him would live. This Jyotirlinga is situated on an island that is said to look like Om, and thus this Jyotirlinga is called Omkareshwar.
            Soon the sages and other gods got to know about the visit of Lord Shiva. They too came and worshipped Lord Shiva. They requested Lord Shiva to live on the mainland as well, and Lord Shiva agreed.He split the Jyotirlinga into two parts: Omkareshwar and Amaleswara. In the form of Omkareshwar, Lord Shiva lives on the island and Amaleswara lives on the mainland.</p>
