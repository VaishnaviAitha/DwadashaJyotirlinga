            Temple in Rameswaram,Tamil Nadu, has its origins rooted in Hindu mythology. Legend has it that Lord Rama, after 
            defeating Ravana and rescuing Sita, worshipped Lord Shiva here to cleanse himself of the sin of killing 
            Ravana, who was a Brahmin. The temple's construction is attributed to various rulers, including the Pandya 
            and Nayak dynasties, and it reflects the Dravidian architectural style. The temple gained prominence due to its 
            association with the mythical bridge, Rama Setu, built by Lord Rama. The complex features grand corridors and 22 
            theerthams (holy water tanks), making it a revered pilgrimage site for Hindus. Pilgrims believe that a visit to 
            the Ramnathaswamy Temple holds immense spiritual significance and aids in attaining purification and divine blessings.
