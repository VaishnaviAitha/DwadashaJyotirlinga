            Jyotirlinga, located in Deoghar, Jharkhand, is a sacred Hindu shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva.
            According to legend, Ravana, the demon king, received a Lingam from Shiva with the condition not to place 
            it on the ground until reaching Lanka. Gods intervened, and Vishnu, in disguise, placed the Lingam in Deoghar,
            where it rooted. Despite Ravana's attempts, the Lingam stayed, and the present Baidyanath Jyotirlinga temple 
            stands at this spot. Devotees believe the Lingam's presence grants divine blessings. The temple attracts pilgrims,
            especially during Maha Shivaratri, celebrating Lord Shiva. This legend intertwines mythology with the spiritual 
            significance of Baidyanath Jyotirlinga as a revered pilgrimage destination in Hinduism.
