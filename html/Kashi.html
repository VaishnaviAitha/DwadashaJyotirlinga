        Kashi, also known as Varanasi, is the second home of Lord Shiva and Parvati. Kailash is Lord Shiva’s home, but when he got married to Parvati, they chose to live in Kashi during the winter months.
        
        Lord Shiva and Parvati loved their new home in Kashi. When Parvati’s parents saw their new home, they felt that it is not comfortable enough for their daughter. To please them, Lord Shiva asked one of his devotees to build them a suitable home.
        
        When Parvati saw her husband’s loving gesture, she was elated. She appeared in the form of Annapurna and fed everyone in the city.
        
        Once when Lord Shiva and Parvati were away from Kashi, Brahma brought a new king Divodasa to keep the city running smoothly. Divodasa asked Brahma to allow him to rule with full freedom and thus keep all the gods away from the city.
        
        Brahma’s boon to Divodasa meant that Lord Shiva and Parvati could not come back to their favourite city.
        
        Shiva really wanted to live in Kashi again, so he sent many messengers to request Divodasa to allow them. All the messengers who went to the city loved it so much that they started living in the city instead of returning to Shiva.
        
        Ultimately, Shiva asked for Vishnu’s help. Vishnu went to Divodasa and told him how much Lord Shiva wanted to live in Kashi. By denying them, Divodasa is losing his mental peace and his chance at attaining Moksha.
        
        So Divodas made a Shivlinga and placed it in a beautiful temple. Soon after that Lord Shiva and Parvati came back to Kashi and Divodas got Moksha</p></div>
