To resolve this they announced a competition that whoever goes around the world faster would get married first.
        Kartikeya mounted his peacock and went off. Ganesha knew that he would not be able to overtake his brother while riding his mouse. So, Ganesha asked his parents to sit together, and he went around them saying that they are his entire world.
        Shiva and Parvati were happy by this and decided to marry Ganesha. He got married to Riddhi and Siddhi before Kartikeya came back. When Kartikeya saw that Ganesha was already married, he was hurt and decided to go live elsewhere.
        Kartikeya went to Mount Kraunja and made a home of himself there. Lord Shiva and Parvati missed their son a lot. So they decided to go and pacify him. Kartikeya got calmed, but he chose to live in his new home only. So, Shiva and Parvati too decided to leave a part of themselves to live near him.
        They left a Jyotirlinga called Mallikarjuna there. Mallika another name of Parvati and Shiva is also known as Arjuna.</p>
