    <p style="font-size: 25px;margin-left: 20px;" id="p1" class="para">Once there was a Brahman couple Brahmavetta Sudharm and his wife Sudeha. They were not able to have any children, even after many years. So Sudeha asked her husband to marry her sister, Gushma.

        Gushma was a great devotee of Lord Shiva. Every day she would make a Shivlinga and immerse it in a lake nearby.
        
        Soon Gushma had a son, and everyone was happy. Years went by and the son grew up and got married himself. Over the years, Sudeha started to be jealous of her sister’s son.
        
        One day she killed her stepson and threw his body in the lake. Gushma performed her rituals like every day. When she went to the lake, she found her son well and alive through Lord Shiva’s blessings.
        
        Gushma asked Lord Shiva to stay, and he agreed. He established a Jyotirlinga in the lake which is now known as Grishneshwar, meaning Lord of Compassion.</p>
