    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;" id="p1" class="para">Once there was a severe famine and there was an acute food shortage. Sage Gautama was blessed by gods and he never had any shortage of food. He opened his ashram for everyone and fed everyone who came to him. His generosity caused other sages to feel jealous.

        Other sages planned to hurt sage Gautama. They sent a weak cow to Gautama’s fields. When Gautama saw the cow he tried to feed the cow, but before he could help the cow, it died. That’s when all the other sages came out blaming sage Gautama for the cow’s death.
        
        Sage Gautama was very sad about the death of the cow. He started worshipping Lord Shiva for penance. Gautama made over 100 Shivlinga and his worship pleased Shiva.
        
        When Shiva came, Gautama asked him to send Ganga to wash away his sins. Lord Shiva told him that he committed no sin. Still, Lord Shiva asked Ganga to come down to the sage’s ashram.
        
        Ganga came and was known as the Godavari there. Sage Gautama believed that all his sins were washed away.
        
        In Trimbakeshwar the Jyotirlinga appeared with Godiva river. The Jyotirlinga has faces of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. This is the only Jyotirlinga where all three deities appear together.</p>
