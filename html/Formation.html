    <h1>Formation of Jyotirlinga</h1>
    <div id="Kashi">

    <h2>Kashi Jyotirlinga</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;">Kashi, also known as Varanasi, is the second home of Lord Shiva and Parvati. Kailash is Lord Shiva’s home, but when he got married to Parvati, they chose to live in Kashi during the winter months.Lord Shiva and Parvati loved their new home in Kashi. When Parvati’s parents saw their new home, they felt that it is not comfortable enough for their daughter. To please them, Lord Shiva asked one of his devotees to build them a suitable home.When Parvati saw her husband’s loving gesture, she was elated. She appeared in the form of Annapurna and fed everyone in the city.Once when Lord Shiva and Parvati were away from Kashi, Brahma brought a new king Divodasa to keep the city running smoothly. Divodasa asked Brahma to allow him to rule with full freedom and thus keep all the gods away from the city.Brahma’s boon to Divodasa meant that Lord Shiva and Parvati could not come back to their favourite city.Shiva really wanted to live in Kashi again, so he sent many messengers to request Divodasa to allow them. All the messengers who went to the city loved it so much that they started living in the city instead of returning to Shiva.Ultimately, Shiva asked for Vishnu’s help. Vishnu went to Divodasa and told him how much Lord Shiva wanted to live in Kashi. By denying them, Divodasa is losing his mental peace and his chance at attaining Moksha.So Divodas made a Shivlinga and placed it in a beautiful temple. Soon after that Lord Shiva and Parvati came back to Kashi and Divodas got Moksha.</p></a>

    <img src="kedarnath-original-shivling-271x300.jpg" alt="Kedarnath">
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">After the war in Kurukshetra, the Pandavas went looking for Lord Shiva to seek his forgiveness for killing their kin and causing so much destruction.They found Lord Shiva in Kedarnath. Lord Shiva was not ready to forgive the Pandavas, so he transformed into a bull and hid among the cattle. Pandavas still located him. Then Lord Shiva tried to hide underground. But Bhima pulled him out.Later parts of Lord Shiva appeared in four other places. Together these five places are called Panch Kedar. It is said that Pandas made temples in all these five locations.Kedarnath was the place where Lord Shiva first appeared. A Jyotirlinga containing a part of him appeared in Kedarnath.</p></a>

            <img src="Somnath1.jpg" alt="Somnath" width="600" height="600">
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Daksha was the son of Brahma. He married his 27 daughters to Chandra, the moon god. Chandra loved one of the sisters Rohini very much. So much that Chandra started ignoring his other wives and started spending all of his time with Rohini.Naturally, this angered his remaining 26 wives. They all went to their father Daksha and complained. Daksha then talked to Chandra and reminded him that he had 27 wives and he should take care of each one of them. Chandra agreed but later kept on spending all his time with Rohini only.This angered Daksha too. He cursed Chandra that his body would perish. This impacted everyone since Chandra was the only source of light in the night sky.Chandra and other gods went to Lord Brahma to get his help. Brahma asked Chandra to worship Lord Shiva and ask for his help.As instructed, Chandra made a Shivlinga and started worshipping Shiva. This pleased Shiva, who appeared before him and told him to ask for a boon. Chandra asked Shiva to undo the curse upon him.Shiva told him that the curse can not be undone, but he can minimize the effect. He blessed Chandra that once he perishes, he will again start regaining his body. Shiva also let Chandra live on his head so that no one else could harm him in his weaker state.Thus the moon waxes and wanes. Since then Shiva is also known as Chandrasekhar and Somnath (Som means moon or Chandra).Chandra made a temple where he worshipped Lord Shiva. The Shivlinga that he made transformed into a Jyotirlinga when Lord Shiva agreed to leave a part of himself there</p>

            <img src="Mahakaleshwar-Photos-Ujjain.png" alt="Ujjain_Mahakaleshwar" width="600" height="400">
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Once there was a demon called Dushana who built an army and was terrorizing everyone. One by one they were destroying the cities and villages.When they were coming towards Ujjain, the sages who lived in the nearby forests saw the army. They started praying to Lord Shiva to come and save the city. Even when the demon army was destroying the forest and everything in their path, the sages kept praying.Ultimately, Dushana and his army reached the sages and were about to kill them. Sages didn’t run away seeing the demons. They kept worshipping Lord Shiva. This pleased Lord Shiva and he appeared there himself.
            Lord Shiva was angry and his wrath was directed towards the demon army. A bloody battle took place where Lord Shiva killed Dushana and his entire army.A Jyotirlinga appeared in the place where Lord Shiva first appeared. His this fierce form is known as Mahakal since he came as Lord of Death. This is the reason why the idol in this temple is facing south, unlike all other temples. It is said that only in death one faces south. Lord Shiva is representing death itself and his idol is Dakshinmukhi or facing south.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Once there was an asura named Daruk who lived with his wife, Daruka. Daruka was a great devotee of Parvati and had received a boon from her. The forest where Daruk and Daruka lived moved wherever Daruka went.Wanting to use it to terrorize innocents, Daruk asked his wife to move the forest on a small island. Daruk would then kidnap and bring his victims to this island.
            Once he kidnapped a great Shiva devotee named Supriya. When Supriya was taken to the prison, he started chanting ‘Om Namah Shivaya’. He even encouraged other prisoners to chant the same.
            Seeing his devotion, Lord Shiva decided to help them.He appeared and killed Daruk. Where he appeared, a Jyotirlinga appeared, which was then called Nageshvara or Lord of serpents.</p>
